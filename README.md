## Data Source and Cleaning Process
#### Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from the Data.gov platform. It contains information on government grants awarded to businesses, providing critical insights into the allocation of funds. The dataset consists of a single table with the following 11 columns:
1.	Application ID (Unique Identifier)
2.	Award Amount (Numerical)
3.	Contractor City (Categorical)
4.	Contractor State (Categorical)
5.	Contractor Street (Categorical)
6.	Contractor Type (Categorical)
7.	Primary Contractor Name (Categorical)
8.	Award Date (Date)
9.	Current Date (Date)
10.	Project Title (Categorical)
11.	Project Type (Categorical)

 
#### DATA TYPES
The dataset includes multiple data types:

•	Categorical Data: Contractor city, contractor state, contractor street, contractor type, primary contractor name, project title, and project type.

•	Numerical Data: Award amount.

•	Date Data: Award date and current date.

•	Unique Identifier: Application ID.

### DATA CLEANING PROCESS
To ensure the dataset was suitable for analysis and visualization, it underwent a comprehensive cleaning process using Power BI Power Query:
1.	Removing Duplicates: Ensured data integrity by eliminating duplicate entries.
2.	Data Type Validation: Corrected and assigned appropriate data types (e.g., numerical, date, and categorical) for all columns.
3.	Handling Missing Data: Addressed missing values by either filtering out incomplete rows or filling down values where applicable, depending on the context and impact on analysis.
4.	Final Validation: Reviewed the cleaned dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency before proceeding with any visualization or further analysis.
This cleaning process established a robust foundation for meaningful insights and reliable visualizations.

### Diagnostic Analysis Findings:
Correlation Analysis:

No strong correlation between "Application ID" and "Award Amount (US Dollars)".
Likely, more meaningful relationships exist with categorical variables (e.g., "Contractor Type").
Award Amount Distribution:

Highly right-skewed: Most awards are small, but a few are extremely large (up to $50M).
This suggests a few big projects receive disproportionate funding.
Trends Over Time:

Award amounts fluctuate significantly over time.
Some periods have spikes in funding, possibly due to special programs or funding rounds.
